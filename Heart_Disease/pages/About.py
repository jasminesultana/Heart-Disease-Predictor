    ## 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction App

    This web application predicts the *likelihood of heart disease* based on user-provided medical data.  
    It uses a *Logistic Regression* machine learning model trained on the *UCI Heart Disease Dataset*.

    ---
    ### 📘 Project Overview

    Cardiovascular disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
    Early prediction can help people make informed lifestyle and medical decisions.  

    The *Heart Disease Predictor* simplifies this process by:
    - Collecting 13 essential medical inputs (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure)
    - Feeding them into a trained Logistic Regression model
    - Returning the probability of heart disease presence or absence

    ### ⚙ How It Works

    1. *User Input:*  
       You provide key health indicators like age, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, and more.

    2. *Feature Processing:*  
       Inputs are normalized and aligned to the model’s training features.

    3. *Prediction:*  
       The trained Logistic Regression model outputs:
       - *1* → Presence of heart disease  
       - *0* → Absence of heart disease  
       along with a confidence probability.

    4. *Results Display:*  
       - A progress bar shows prediction confidence  
       - Clear text result summarizing your health prediction

    ### 🧠 Machine Learning Model

    *Algorithm:* Logistic Regression  
    *Library Used:* scikit-learn  
    *Dataset:* UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
    *Training-Test Split:* 60% - 40%  
    *Accuracy:* ~83–85% on test data  

    The model was chosen for:
    - Interpretability (you can see feature impacts)
    - Low computational cost
    - High baseline performance on medical classification problems
